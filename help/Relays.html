  <h3>intro</h3>
  <P>
  Relays are source streams that you may want to re-broadcast over your stream.
  This is accomplished using wget and lame to fetch and re-encode ( to common
  bitrate and samplerate) the data. This functionality is only presented to
  admin users.
  </p>
  <h3>starting</h3>
  <p>
  The way this works is by overriding the Playlogic in radiod.py. When you're
  ready to switch over to another stream, add the stream's URL and a symbolic
  title with the Relays admin page. The title will be displayed as 'Now Playing'
  on the CurrentInfo page. Set the 'Active Relay' to your selected relay. The
  next time radiod.py goes to find a song, it will go into relay mode and begin
  re-broadcasting the relay stream.
  </p>
  <h3>stopping</h3>
  <p>
  To stop the stream, either stop the source from broadcasting or kill it from
  the CurrentInfo page.
