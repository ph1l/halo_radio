  <P>
	Playlists in halo_radio are all managed automaticly via the DBSync
	utility that should be running in cron ;-). Here is a list of
	the playlists and what they contain:
  </p>
	<UL>Playlists
	<LI><B>Master</B> - all songs in the mp3 archive are added to this playlist. This is the default playlist.
	<LI><B>Requested</B> -  all songs that have been requested one or more times.
	<LI><B>Auto-AI</B> - songs that have a positive <I>popularity</i>.
	<LI><B>Announce</B> - songs existing in the <I>announce_path</i>. This
	is a special list, created for announcements. mp3's in this direcly
	will be randomly chosen after <i>announce_delay</i> seconds, and
	forcefully played before the next request or random song selection.
