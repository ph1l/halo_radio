Since the initial release on freshmeat, i've decided to try and document
all the changes you'll need to the database and the config file to upgrade
from one release to the next. Most of the cool parts of the halo_radio
system come with the accumulated statistical data in the db. therefore
it would suck to loose all your precious data just because you want to run
the latest release.

Upgrade notes for now can be found in the Changelog file included with the
source.

Here's the basic procedure:

1) untar your new distro next to the onld one and make a new symlink

    $ cd /home/radio/
    $ tar -zxvf halo_radio-xxx.tar.gz
    $ rm halo_radio
    $ ln -s  halo_radio-xxx halo_radio

2) Copy config from old version.

    $ cp halo_radio-yyy/HaloRadio.ini halo_radio-xxx/
    
3) Update DB and config file

    using the notes for the release in ChangeLog update your database and
    and config file with additions and changes. also, read through the notes
    on other changes in the release.

4) Re-install the web interface

    $ ./install_web.sh ~/public_html/

5) Re-start your radio source daemon. (assuming your running in daemontools)

    $ killall radiod.py

6) find bugs and report them to me ;-)



cheers.
